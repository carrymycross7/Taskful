Task managing web app
This is a task managing app based in the web browser using HTML/CSS/JS/Express/NODE/MongoDB.
The app is designed to help a user send email reminders to them selves for important or day to day tasks they need to complete within a certain time.
Idealy, a user would have messages from this app forwarded into a specific folder, as to not be mixed in with normal day to day emails
